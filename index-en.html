                                    <p>The members of the piano duo Fourhands started working together in the autumn of 2021
                                        while preparing an Advent concert. Their first piece together was a suite from Tchaikovsky’s
                                        ballet <em>The Nutcracker</em>, and soon the idea arose to expand the programme with other
                                        ballet music so that the concerts under the title “Fairytale Ballets” would form a themed
                                        whole. Since then, they have played numerous concerts together and, besides four-hand
                                        standards, they enjoy broadening their repertoire with other musical genres.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>At present they organise concerts focused mainly on works by leading Czech composers,
                                        such as Dvořák’s <em>Slavonic Dances</em> and the complete cycle <em>Má vlast</em> by Bedřich
                                        Smetana. They also perform jazz pieces by contemporary Czech composers, arrangements of
                                        orchestral and symphonic works and film music. They give educational concerts for schools as
                                        well. In addition to four-hand piano music they also include compositions for two pianos.
                                        As part of their concerts and projects they cooperate, among others, with the artist
                                        agencies Globarts and Fidelio and with the composer Zdeněk Král.
